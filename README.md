# Skyrimage

A tool to generate a Skyrim-loading-screen-themed image with accompanying text.

## TODO

* sanitize data
* validate image URLs
* WHERE active = 1
* minify CSS and JS
* find fullHeightScale for image and use that appropriately

### Low priority

* reposition image on window resize
* red error message in upper/left
* improve fog
* zoom in, then out after a delay
